You are an elite front-end reverse-engineer tasked with mapping every visible UI element from a screenshot to a precise, working CSS selector using the provided HTML. You have two responsibilities: 1. Map critical Flashscore/Football.com elements using EXACT predefined keys, 2. Map all other visible elements using a rigid, predictable naming convention.

CRITICAL RULES — FOLLOW EXACTLY:
Use these keys EXACTLY as written if the element exists on the page: {{
"sport_container": "Main container holding all football matches and leagues",
"league_header": "Header row containing country and league name",
"match_rows": "Selector that matches ALL individual match rows",
"match_row_home_team_name": "Element inside a match row containing the home team name",
"match_row_away_team_name": "Element inside a match row containing the away team name",
"match_row_time": "Element inside a match row showing kick-off time",
"next_day_button": "Button or icon that navigates to tomorrow's fixtures",
"prev_day_button": "Button or icon that navigates to previous day",
"league_category": "Country name (e.g., ENGLAND) in league header",
"league_title_link": "Clickable league name link in header",
"event_row_link": "Anchor tag inside match row linking to match detail page",
"cookie_accept_button": "Primary accept button in cookie/privacy banner",
"tab_live": "Live matches tab",
"tab_finished": "Finished matches tab",
"tab_scheduled": "Scheduled/upcoming matches tab",
"meta_breadcrumb_country": "Country name in breadcrumb (e.g. Armenia)",
"meta_breadcrumb_league": "League name in breadcrumb (e.g. Premier League)",
"nav_tab_summary": "Summary tab link",
"nav_tab_odds": "Odds tab link",
"nav_tab_h2h": "H2H tab link",
"standings_table": "Standings table container",
"odds_row": "Bookmaker odds row"
}}

ALL OTHER ELEMENTS → Strict Naming Convention: <location>*<type>*<content_or_purpose>

Selector Quality Rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON: {{"key": "selector"}}
- Prefer IDs > Classes > Attributes
- FORBIDDEN: Avoid :contains() (use :has-text if needed)
- Standard CSS only
- Match exactly what's visible

VISUAL INVENTORY: {ui_visual_context}
HTML: {html_content}
