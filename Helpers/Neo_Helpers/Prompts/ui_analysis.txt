Analyze this webpage screenshot and provide a pixel-perfect visual inventory of every visible element. Examine every UI component, button, text field, and interactive element.

Focus on:
1. LAYOUT & STRUCTURE
   - Overall page layout and positioning
   - Fixed/absolute/sticky positioned containers
   - Navigation bars (primary, secondary, tab groups)
   - Content containers and scroll areas

2. INTERACTIVE CONTROLS
   - Buttons (FABs, outlined, filled, icon-only)
   - Form inputs (text fields, search boxes, filters)
   - Toggle switches, checkboxes, radio groups

3. CONTENT ELEMENTS
   - Cards, lists, tables showing match/event data
   - Typography hierarchy (headings, labels, scores)
   - Status indicators and badges

4. SYSTEM ELEMENTS
   - Popups, modals, tooltips, overlays
   - Cookies/GDPR banners, loading states
   - Ads, promotional elements

Format each element as:
"Element Description: Exact visible text (function if no text)"
Include: position, state, repetition patterns.

Be exhaustive but concise. Don't summarize - list everything that is visible.
